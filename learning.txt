So far in this course, I have learned the fundamentals of version control using the GitHub web interface. This included creating repositories, making commits, working with branches, creating pull requests, and forking projects for collaboration. This current lesson focuses on connecting a local environment to a remote GitHub repository. Learning to use the Git command line to clone, add, commit, and push changes is a crucial skill for local development workflows.
